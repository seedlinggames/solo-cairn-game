# Last Town

From this angle, some people guess that it's First Town, but from the the perspective of the town, it's the edge of the world.

You have a bit of initial cred among adventurious types, and feel a bit of suspicion from the more upstanding citizens. It's well known that it's usually criminals who come out of the wilds this way, and there are old stories of raiders coming out of the Marches, before the Marches swore fealty to the Duchy.

## Miner's office 

Semi-legal 

## The (something) inn 

Would-be explorers of the ruins. When you hire one, roll 3d6 for each ability score and 

The more stories you tell, the more credibility you have here. Tell a good story and you can probably get a hireling on a promise of future money with just a few GP upfront. Get a reputation here and you'll get others. 

> I come up with ideas for NPCs by rolling on tables I've created.
> I also often roll for gender. It keeps me from falling into stereotypes, but also not over-thinking it if I think I'm falling into a sterotype - for instance, I think NPC #2 is a bit of a stereotype here of the "token female character". In this case I decided to do one male, one female, one non-binary, and one wildcard (rolled male). The traits ended up being ones that match maybe a bit too well, but that's also ok. 


hireling 1: Quiet guy, despite being tall, dresses warm for the weather, doens't drink. In his 40s, one of the older ones here. Is in a lot of debt after falling for a scam. Looking for something sensible. Believes in keeping his word to a fault. (honesty, calm) CArries a cudgel (d6)



hireling 2: A thief, she looks out for #1 and is used to skirting the law to survive. She has a price on her head from a young age and isn't afraid to cross the border. She respects you for being a survivor, though, and won't bite the hand that feeds her. If you show her loyalty she might show a surprising amount back, but try and double-cross her and she'll double-cross you first. She has a very plain appearance - the last person you notice in a crowd. In their late 20s. (cunning, survival) Carries a dagger (d6)

hireling 3: A holy mystic who had a dream of a statue in a fortress under the earth in the Marches. They believe in kindness even when it is not returned and often speak in religious proverbs. They ask for no pay, but they are likely to make demands of what actions you take and decisions you make as you travel. (tradition, mercy) They are quite short, and are very plainly dressed except for some really nice walking books - if asked about it, they will say that the gods make an exception for pratical travel footware. In their late 30s. CArries a staff (d6)

hireling 4: He is doing this mostly on a dare. Reckless and novelty-seeking, he doesn't respect anyone he thinks is a coward. He's not quite as young as he looks, but not all that much older at 20 years old. He has a big red wide-brimmed hat that stands out. (boldness, novelty) Carries a flashy but poor-quality shortsword (d6)


## Merchant clearing-house 

Mostly do volumes too large to be relevant to you, but in addition to being taxed, goods are "diverted" - sometimes these are hirelings of the merchants being paid in goods that they want to turn into something more portable. Sometimes that's the workers there managing to steal and resell some stuff. For that reason, you must be a member of the porter's guild, a de facto gang, to work in the clearinghouse proper.

The market you can actually buy things 

## Messenger house
Carry messages. Have them periodically, swap out fresh horses. Belongs to the government

## The government bureaucracy building
A inn but you have to be invited 

A mix of soldiers who were posted here, and the tax collectors that collect from the merchants that come past. 

There is a military commander. Views the Marquess's soldiers with some contempt - 

### Military leader
Than, the military leader, values honesty and selfless devotion to the Duchy. Her great-grandfather was killed in the war of the Marches and holding this grudge is a key part of her identity. A buckle in the shape of five leaves holding up a shoulder-belt is the only mark of her status. She views herself and her soldiers as above whatever crime might be happening in the town - she views it as an inevitabiluty.

She might be willing to hire you for jobs she finds insufficiently honorable for her soldiers. Alternately, she might see you as a disposable alternative.

### Civilian leader
Bawin, the leader, believes in doing what is necessary to keep order, and that life is inherently not fair, as evidenced by the fact that he has been posted here. He gives long and expressive speeches according a book of rhetoric he reads, but ultimately does very little as long as he can send the tax money back. 

He can be bribed for a badge saying you represent the duchy, but he isn't cheap to bribe - looking at 1000gp

It is well known that Than thinks Bawin is weak and corrupt, and that Bawin thinks Than is a naive brute. 


## The earthquake temple 

They keep the earthquake at bay. Once a year they travel into the woods to perform a series of rituals, and hire adventurers to do this.

THey will heal you, but you have to pay - you pay in favours though.
