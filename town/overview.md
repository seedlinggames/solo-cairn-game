# Last Town

From the direction you are coming, you might call it First Town, but from the perspective of those living in the Duchy across the hills, this is the edge of the world.

You have some initial credibility among adventurous types, coming from beyond Last Town, but more upstanding citizens will show you a bit of suspicion. It's well known that it's usually criminals who come out of the wilds this way, and there are old stories of raiders coming out of the Marches, before the Marches swore fealty to the Duchy.

If you're here, you work for the merchants, the government, or the military. Or, you're here on your own seeking your fortune. This town is really only supposed to exist for the benefit of the government, and no matter how wealthy you might become, you will never quite be ompletely welcome here.
