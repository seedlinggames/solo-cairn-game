## Merchant clearing-house 
They mostly deal in volumes of goods too large to be relevant to you, but in addition to being taxed, goods are "diverted" here. Hirelings of the merchants might get paid in raw goods that they want to turn into portable coin. Sometimes workers here manage to steal and resell some stuff. You must be a member of the porter's guild to work in the clearinghouse proper so they can keep their monopoly on theft and keep it at a level where the merchants don't crack down on it. The guild also provides security for the place. 

If you want to buy a specific item here, check the oracle to see if it's available. If not, you could get it in a week with a few extra gold pieces to speed things along.

Inside there is also an inn where the merchants stay (though generally not their hirelings). You are unlikely to be invited in unless you have done a particularly large favour for a merchant, or one of them really wants to talk to you in private.

> It would be possible for you to work there, but less profitable and more boring than adventuring. If you manage to spend a month or so working there, roll 3d6 for the number of gold pieces you have left over after living expenses, similar to your starting gold. You aren't paid enough to consistently save money beyond that.
