# What is this?
This is a work in progress for the [A Town, A Forest, A Dungeon](https://itch.io/jam/a-town-a-forest-a-dungeon) jam on Itch. I'll eventually move this to an itch submission. 

It's also meant as a sort of a tutorial to playing Cairn solo. As such, I'll keep at least a text version of it free of charge, and so might as well work on this semi publicly here.

I'll also be talking about it under the hashtag #aTownAForestADungeon on my [Mastodon](https://dice.camp/@seedling) account.

Right now the pages don't flow together in order at all.

Start with the [table of contents](table_of_contents.md).

# TO DO
- [ ] Give all the dungeon rooms a number and refer to them and their transitions that way
- [ ] Complete the description of the overland hex map 
- [ ] Playtest
- [ ] Make sure this accomplishes the goal of actually being a tutorial for playing cairn solo
- [ ] General proofreading + revising
- [ ] Printable layout
- [ ] Actually draw all the maps and also rotate them so that north is up, they're like that for a reason right now and the reason is that I drew a sketch of the map and then realized that north should be a different direction to correspond to the hex  map in a logical way
- [ ] Do I want to rename the monsters or rename anything
