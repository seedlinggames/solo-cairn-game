# The road, and east of the river.

It's twice as fast to walk along the road, and you can see about a mile away. If you aren't careful though, they can see you. 

The area along the road is kept free of trees, and trees are sparse on the east bank of the river, but the land is rough and rocky and covered with low brush on either side of the road.

> The intention is that the road is something you will want to avoid unless you can come up with a scheme to make it safe for you, or get to the town to resolve your situation.

Random encounters:
1. A pair of soldiers on horseback, patrolling
2. 2d4 soldiers camping by the side of the road
3. A small ruin that provides some shelter
4. A small empty building, which doesn't seem to be currently in use, but also which doesn't seem to have been abandoned for long
5. The empty road
6. 2d4 bandits 
7. A group of travelers into town
8. An armed expedition, consisting of a detachment of soldiers and horses pulling wagons 
9. A temporary checkpoint on the road: 1d6 + 1 soldiers checking travelers' papers 
10. An obstruction in the road: flooding, a mudslide, or the road has collapsed into the river. A traveler is trying to get a cart through.

Soldier reactions
1. Attack immediately, assuming you're a bandit, and will pursue you as long as they can
2. Want to arrest you and take you to the camp, and will pursue you if you flee
3. Want to arrest you and take you to the camp, but won't pursue you very far if you flee
4. Want to search you, might confiscate any weapons
5. Will direct you somewhere, such as demanding that you turn around and go back the way you came
6. Indifferent; warn you about bandits

Bandit reactions
1. Attack immediately
2. Will attack unless you can give them something of value
3. See you as a potential problem - will attack if you don't leave and if they see you again
4. Indifferent - you don't seem worth robbing
5. Indifferent - you don't seem worth robbing, but could be willing to do a favour for a favour
6. Friendly and sympathetic, if you don't seem wealthy. 

Traveler reactions

Remember that travelers are mostly allowed to be on the road, usually merchants, and under the protection of the soldiers, who they mostly are grateful to for providing protection in this dangerous land full of suspicious characters like yourself, and see regular inspections by the soldiers as a small price to pay. If you seem to be avoiding the soldiers, that seems suspicious.

1. Demand you stay away, and will attack if you don't
2. Afraid of you: they avoid you or flee
3. Indifferent - no interest in talking
4. Indifferent - exhange pleasantries, but 
5. Mildly friendly - willing to answer questions about road conditions
6. Enthusiastic about having company on the road


## The camp

The river passes through some narrow, rocky rapids, and the road goes up the hill and over a cliff overlooking the river. The camp is at this chokepoint.

This semi permanent structure contains at least a detachment of soldiers at all times, plus about 10 other staff to maintain it. They keep horses here - it's about one day's travel by horse from where you started. 

They also have a camp of various criminals who have been tasked with repairing roads, clearing brush, chopping down trees and collecting firewood. You could end up here, if things go badly. Anyone who you help escape might be able to join you for the rest of the trip, but tehy will be *deprived* until they can rest.

It is from this location that they try and maintain control of these lands. They send regular patrols east, but have trouble controlling the area west of the river, on account of the forest and the lack of roads. 

The leader of the camp, named Odep, likes to think of himself as fair and impartial, but hard choices need to be made to tame this land. They are older than most soldiers grow to be, and have been here many years, and prides himself on knowing the land better than most. Only in the most dire circumstances will he venture out again,t hough.

## Tree Island

Not an actual island, but a hill in the uplands much bigger than the others, and strangely round. Its rocks are steep and hard to climb, but even harder for soldiers on horseback or in armour. If you need to run east, it's the closest thing to a safe place in miles.
