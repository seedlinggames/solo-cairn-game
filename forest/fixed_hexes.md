## The poacher hut

On the approach to their hut, you see chunks of bloody meat hanging from hooks in the trees. If you approach carefully, you will spot some bear traps, but if you for some reason are running through the woods, you will get trapped.

> One thing with solo games is I often draw a bit from story games, thinking about my character in the third person - what would they do? It's hard to surprise yourself with pre-made adventure content, so it can be useful to shift your attitude a bit and think about what makes sense in the story, even if it's not the best character decision. You could draw on your character traits to decide what they would do. 

Fureb, her wife Moili, her brother Tath and his two kids. They live together in the woods and survive off of hunting. They will greet you with drawn weapons, but have no desire to hurt you - they are just suspicious. They haven't seen a friendly face in many years.  If you are wounded when you arrive, they will nurse you back to health.

They leave a portion of each kill out for the Night Hunters, which they describe as coming out at night. They say they need to keep them fed.

Fureb speaks bluntly and directly. Her face is weathered and gaunt, revealing she's had a hard life. She values frugality, and is unimpressed with wealth. She is a wanted criminal back in the Lowlands, and is the de facto leader of the group.

Moili values loyalty - not to any authority, but to friends and family - above all else. She has distinctive scars from some clawed creature.

Tath is calm, quiet and level-headed, and values the same in others. He has a somewhat unnerving stare. Despite all this, he is the most likely to be sympathetic to strangers.

The kids are very excited to see strangers.

If you make a good imkpression, Moili would travel with you to just outside of Last Town, in exchange for going into town to purchase some useful tools for her.

## The successful miners 

They are from Last Town, and have ventured out further than the others, and have found a vein of gold. They know that what they are doing is illegal. If you get on their good side, they can tell you a route back (fill in the squares in advance of visiting them.)

Five miners and one leader, with five more that are at any time foraging for food, smuggling supplies in from Last Town, or scouting for rivals or soldiers. The leader dresses extravagantly, showing off his wealth, and is generous with food and drink. He values ambition, and could be convinced to go along with a suitably ambitious (or foolish) plan, especially one that makes money. This is true so long as he is in charge, though.

Another miner, who speaks with excessive propriety, is secretly planning a mutiny with the others. He is loyal to his companions and ruthless to anyone he sees as getting in his way.

## The hills 
These both take four hours to climb, but give a good view. On the east side, you are likely to get spotted by the soldiers, who will go see what you're up to.

## The canyon 

The road leaves the river here for a reason. The river gets very fast and goes down a waterfall here. Boats can't navigate this, and swimming and surviving here is almost unheard of. Make a STR save to not drown, and even if you succeed, take 1d10 STR damage from the rocks. If you do succeed, though, someone at the fort is certainly going to see you and word of your incredible feat will sppread.
