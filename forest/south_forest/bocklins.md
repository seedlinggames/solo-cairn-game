If you save one of their lives - and it can't be you who put their life in danger - they will save your life exactly once. Then they will give you a gift (TODO). After that, the debt is paid and they will go back to hunting you.

Stats during the day:

4 HP, 10 STR 10 DEX 12 WIL, dagger (d6)
- Appear as human, except for their tell-tale eyes.
- Usually carrying a wooden mask of a terrible monster, which they try to conceal. If the mask is destroyed, they die.

## Relic: piece of a Bocklin mask

If a bocklin owes you a serious favour, such as if you saved their life, they might repay it by giving you a bocklin amulet (1 charge), made of a piece of a Bocklin mask.

When worn, you may use the amulet to grow claws. With those claws, you can easily climb trees and other rough natural structures, and as long as your hands are free, they do d6 + d6 damage. 

This lasts until the sun rises, or you stand next to a fire. Someone else can hold a torch, but you cannot.

To recharge, eat a pound of raw meat. This is likely to disagree with your digestive system and you might be Deprived for a day afterwards.

> This is inspired by a piece of art from Evlyn Moreau which will be added in later

## Becoming a Bocklin

If you have a Bocklin amulet, use it a lot for a month or two, living mostly in the woods, you might be given your own mask. 

First, roll 3d6, and if it is higher than your current DEX, this becomes your new DEX.

Your eyes are permanently cat-like, and this tell-tale sign will make you, at best, unwelcome among the parts of human society which know what you are. 

During the night, as long as you stay in darkness, you grow long claws, and long teeth, doing d8 + d8 damage, and you have superhuman climbing abilities so long as your claws can dig into the surface in question. You return to human form when the sun rises, or if you enter the light of a bonfire, fireplace, or other similar light source, or if you hold a torch. You are also compelled to repay any significant favour done to you.

You can heal attribute points through cannibalism; this is now the only way you can heal attribute points. You are immune to most mundane diseases. You might have trouble entering consecrated spaces.
