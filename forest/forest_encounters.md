## North of the Rapids
This area is less wild. There is still forest, but it's patchy and drier.

There were gold mines in the hills around here, and now people still come to seek their fortune. This gold of course belongs to the Marquess, and anyone doing that is breaking the law. The Marquess's soldiers intend to take control of this region next.

Wild food is scarce here. It takes 3 hours of foraging to find food for one day.

Random solider encounters


### The Great Gold Beast

It eats the gold that people mine, and often the people mining it.  It was born from the blood of someone who killed and died for gold, and grows stronger whenever anyone kills another person over gold. If all the miners left the area, it would starve.

It's generally well known that gold miners are most at risk from this, although as most people carry at least a gold coin or ring on them, nobody is safe. The story of how it came into being is a local folktale, though thj

It's a large, squat, bulky reptilian-shaped creature, only covered in hair, each hair with a slight gold sheen.

It has a single, enormous gold nugget worth 2000 gp in its belly.

12 HP, 3 armor, 16 STR, 12 DEX, 13 WIL, trample (d8+d8), detachment 

- Roughly the size of an elephant, but will grow if the soldiers and the miners start fighting over the gold in earnest
- Typically stampedes through an area, swallows a single victim, and then runs off.
- Every time a human is deliberately killed over gold in the region, it gains 1 HP. For every two HP it gains, it gains 1 STR, up to a maximum of 18. It also grows about a foot taller. 
- Critical damage: Swallow you whole.

### Random encounters type 2

If you have the Herbalist background, you can spend 1 hour to find food, otherwise it'll take 4

1. You find an ancient stone building. You can sleep here, but you have strange dreams of being hunted.
2. A man with cat-like eyes is caught in a deadfall trap but still alive. He tries to defend himself with a dagger, while a gaunt woman with greying hair and a dagger as well circles him, trying to finish him off. She will tell you that he is a terrible monster. If you save the man, see XXX. If you side with the woman, see XXX.
3. You find a dead rabbit caught in a trap. You could eat it, but someone might come looking for it (see XXX)
4. A black bear really wants to keep you out of a clearing. You see a tarnished silver chalice worth about 50 GP in the middle.
5. You find a bush full of unfamiliar berries. They'll feed you, but after eating them [test WIL to not fall asleep. If you had the herbalist background you knew that]
6. 2d4 wolves. They keep their distance but follow you for a while. They're used to hunters leaving offal to scavenge, but they'll prey on a wounded human as well.
7. You stumble across one of the poachers (see XXX). Roll on the oracle to see if they react well. If they do, they might take you back to their camp (See XXX)
8. Another fugitive in the woods, mildly wounded. They're willing to team up with you and get back to Last Town [todo stats]
9. An ancient stone temple. Supernatural creatures cannot harm you here. If you leave an offering, such as a day's worth of food, in the manner you are familiar with, at some point while traveling through the forests, something will spontaneously go well in your favour. 
10. A pool full of small edible fish with very sharp teeth (2 HP, 4 STR, 14 DEX, 10 WIL, bite(d6)
11. A fugitive in the woods with cat-like eyes, who tells you they have been unjustly accused of witchcraft. They offer to come back to last town with you, but will insist that you not use fire, because of a recent bad experience. They know a safe place around here to rest. See [xxx - they will turn into a monster at night and try and kill you]
12. 2 soldiers. They had a third - their commander - who was killed by a terrible creature at night. They're lost and trying to find their way back. It might be possible to convince them to desert, but they might also turn you in.

Night encounter:

You travel at a quarter speed. To go faster, make a DEX save to avoid twisting your ankle.
If you don't sleep at night, you'll be deprived the next day. If you haven't found someone to take turns keeping watch with, though, if anything happens, you won't have your armour on and you won't be able to react right away. You'll also need to test the oracle to see if the fire keeps burning unattended all night.

1. Nothing happens, you have a restful night. 
2. A blood elk. Will attack if you have harmed or eaten an animal of the forest, otherwise it will simply stampede through making a lot of noise.
3. A black bear. Unless you have found a way to secure your food, it will try to eat any food you have and attack if you get in the way. Otherwise, just passing through
4. A bocklin, satiated, but tries to steal or sabotage your equipment in case it gets hungry later. Make a WIL save to wake up before it does.
5. A single bocklin hunts you, but with some amount of caution. If you have a fire going, it'll try and lure you out (use an oracle to see if it figures out something that works)
6. 1d4 bocklin hunt you. If they can't lure you out from the fire, they will keep you awake all night and hope that the next night you will collapse from exhaustion.


## The Night Hunters (or the Bocklins)

They have catlike eyes and very long teeth, finger sthat are too long and end in claws, and shaggy fur. They only appear at night, and avoid large fires.

They hunt people in the woods and eat them. They seem to prefer to hunt humans, but if provided with ample fresh non-human meat they will be satisfied.

Stats at night:
8 HP, 12 STR 14 DEX 12 WIL, claws and bite (d8 + d8)
- Look human at first glance, but covered in fur, with clawed hands and very long teeth
- Human-like, but with clawed hands and long teeth.
- Climb trees easily and often attack from above.
- Cat-like eyes allow them to see if there is any source of light at all, including moonlight
- Return to human form when the sun rises, or when they stand for long by a fire. You are safe within the circle of a bonfire, but a torch is not big enough.
