## The fort

The river passes through some narrow, rocky rapids, and the road goes up the hill and over a cliff overlooking the river. The fort is at this chokepoint, overlooking the river and keeping control of the road. This structure contains at least a detachment of soldiers at all times, plus about 10 other staff to maintain it. There's a stable of horses and a kennel of dogs. It's about one day on horseback between the guard post where you started and the fort. 

Just beyond the fort is a camp with various criminals who have been tasked with repairing roads, clearing brush from around the roads, chopping down trees and collecting firewood. You ould end up here, if things go badly. Anyone who you help escape might be able to join you for the rest of the trip, but tehy will be *deprived* until they can rest.

This fort is used to try and maintain control of the farthest lands belonging to the Marquess. They patrol the arid plateau to the east of the river regularly, and send out patrols to intercept any travelers which they see. Their efforts to control the land to the west of the river is a lot more limited, though.

The leader of the camp, named Odep, likes to think of himself as fair and impartial, but hard choices need to be made to tame this land. He is older than most soldiers ever live to become, and has been here many years. He prides himself on knowing the land better than most. In his younger days he scouted out much of the forest and knows more of its ruins than anyone. Only in the most dire circumstances will he venture out again, though.

## West of the river
Dry rolling hills, covered mostly in dry brush and grass. You can see anyone coming from miles away, and the soldiers with their horses have the advantage here over anyone on foot. You'll also need to carry water with you soemhow if you head this way, with one inventory slot for every 6 daytime hours being needed, or become *deprived*.

## Tree Island (6-4)
This is not an actual island, but a hill on the plateau that's much bigger than the others. It's strangely round, and unlike the rest of the plateau, it's covered in trees. It's not possible for a soldier on horseback to climb this hill, and even on foot, you have the chance to hide.
