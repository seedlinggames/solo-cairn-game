## The hills 
These both take four hours to climb, but give a good view. On the east side, you are likely to get spotted by the soldiers, who will go see what you're up to.

![Hex map, mostly uncovered. There are mountains to the north and west. To the north there's a city in a gap in the mountains. In the center of the map is a fort and three hills. North of the fort you have dry forest to the west and badlands to the east. There are some trees in the middle of the bandlands. To the south is forest with a road and river passing through.](./img/map_from_hills.png)

## The canyon 

The road leaves the river here for a reason. The river gets very fast and goes down a waterfall here. Boats can't navigate this, and swimming and surviving here is almost unheard of. Make a STR save to not drown, and even if you succeed, take 1d10 STR damage from the rocks. If you do succeed, though, someone at the fort is certainly going to see you and word of your incredible feat will sppread.
