### Random road encounters

**Random encounters:**
1. A pair of soldiers on horseback, patrolling, with a trained dog for tracking.
2. 2d4 soldiers camping by the side of the road.
3. An armed expedition, consisting of a detachment of soldiers and horses pulling wagons, and 1d6 dogs.
4. A checkpoint on the road: 1d6 + 1 soldiers checking travelers' papers. 
5. A messenger, traveling fast on horseback, who will report what they saw on the road when they reach their destination.
6. An obstruction in the road: flooding, a mudslide, or the road has collapsed into the river. A traveler is trying to get a cart through.
7. A group of travelers into town.
8. 2d4 bandits.
9. A small empty building, which doesn't seem to be currently in use, but also which doesn't seem to have been abandoned for long.
10. The empty road.

If the soldiers are on alert - for instance, you fight them and some of them flee - switch to a d8, then a d6, then a d4, each time you give them reason to increase their security.

If it's night, any people you might encounter are camped and have set a watch, except for the messenger.

**Random encounters when camped at night**
1. Nothing
2. A pair of soldiers on horseback pass by.
3. 1d4 bandits stumble across the area.
4. A messenger passes through
5. A bear wanders out of the forest, attracted by any food you might have.
6. Roll a nighttime encounter from [the southern forest](../south_forest/forest_encounters.md) or [the northern forest](../north_forest/north_forest_encounters.md) as approprite.


**Soldier reactions**
1. Attack immediately, assuming you're a bandit, and will pursue you as long as they can
2. Want to arrest you and take you to the camp, and will pursue you if you flee
3. Want to arrest you and take you to the camp, but won't pursue you very far if you flee
4. Want to search you, might confiscate any weapons
5. Will direct you somewhere, such as demanding that you turn around and go back the way you came
6. Indifferent; warn you about bandits

If you are captured by the soldiers, and are north of teh fort where you started, they will take you to the [fort](./fort.md) that you saw in the distance, unless you manage to escape.

**Bandit reactions**
1. Attack immediately
2. Will attack unless you can give them something of value
3. See you as a potential problem - will attack if you don't turn around and go the other way
4. Indifferent - you don't seem worth robbing
5. Indifferent - you don't seem worth robbing, but could be willing to do a favour for a favour
6. Friendly and sympathetic, if you don't seem wealthy. 

**Traveler reactions**

Travelers are mostly allowed to be on the road, and are under the protection of the soldiers. They are generally grateful to the soldiers for providing protection in this dangerous land full of bandits and dangerous fugitives from the law such as yourself. They are accustomed to regular inspections from the soldiers, and expect you to feel the same way.

1. Demand you stay away, and will attack if you don't
2. Afraid of you: they avoid you or flee
3. Indifferent - no interest in talking
4. Indifferent - exhange pleasantries
5. Mildly friendly - willing to answer questions about road conditions
6. Enthusiastic about having company on the road

**Other considerations**
The people you meet don't exist in isolation. If you fight some soldiers and the rest run away, expect a larger force to be sent down the road soon. If you travel with a merchant for a while, they might recognize your description and tell one of the soldiers (use the oracle for this!)
