# North Forest Overview

Here the dense forest opens up into a drier, hillier area, criss-crossed with small streams, trenches dug into the ground, and visible signs of gold mining in the past. The trees are patchier and twisted, the ground sandy and poor, the grass mostly dry in the summer sun.

Occasionally there is a sign that someone else has been here more recently, come to seek their fortune. This gold of course belongs to the Marquess, and anyone removing gold from the area is breaking the law. The Marquess's soldiers intend to take control of this region next.

Wild food is scarce here. It takes 3 hours of foraging to find food for one day.
