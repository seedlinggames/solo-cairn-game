### The Great Gold Beast

It eats the gold that people mine, and often the people mining it.  It was born from the blood of someone who killed and died for gold, and grows stronger whenever anyone kills another person over gold. If all the miners left the area, it would starve.

It's generally well known that gold miners are most at risk from this, although as most people carry at least a gold coin or ring on them, nobody is safe. The story of how it came into being is a local folktale, though thj

It's a large, squat, bulky reptilian-shaped creature, only covered in hair, each hair with a slight gold sheen.

It has a single, enormous gold nugget worth 2000 gp in its belly.

12 HP, 3 armor, 16 STR, 12 DEX, 13 WIL, trample (d8+d8), detachment 

- Roughly the size of an elephant, but will grow if the soldiers and the miners start fighting over the gold in earnest
- Typically stampedes through an area, swallows a single victim, and then runs off.
- Every time a human is deliberately killed over gold in the region, it gains 1 HP. For every two HP it gains, it gains 1 STR, up to a maximum of 18. It also grows about a foot taller. 
- Critical damage: Swallow you whole.
