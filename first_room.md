# The first room

> Note: This first part is relatively on rails, becaus the intention is to introduce you to different aspects of Cairn mechanics as well as playing solo. It will open up and become a more typical adventure later.
> You could just fight the guards, but it's not a very safe choice. You rather want to use your background and (limited) toosl to solve problems creatively.

You were arrested by the Marquess's soldiers, for reasons you previously determined. You have been imprisoned in what seems to be a repurposed ruin that has been largely covered by a landslide. On your way up, you went up a spiral staircase, down a hallway, and now you are in a small room locked shut with a portcullis. It looks like this room once had stairs down, but a landslide collapsed that part of the tower. 


## The room itself 

It is 10 feet by 10 feet, has stone walls and no windows. It looks like the portcullis was once raised by winch in this room, but the rope has been removed and been moved to the hallway, out of reach. The floor is made of wood and seems to be recent: basically four rough wooden squares that rock slightly as you walk on them. There is a bed of straw on top of the floorboards, a wooden bucket, and nothing else.

## The hallway 

The hallway also has improvised wooded walls, nailed in place. A narrow window is thoroughly blocked by some large rocks and heavily packed dirt. Across the hall is a raised portcullis and another wall with a door which has been added in after the fact. A lamp hangs by your door and by the other door, just a little too high for you to reach without finding a way to get closer.

## The portcullis 

The bars are old and there is some superficial rust. They are not too tightly spaced; if one were removed you could squeeze through.

If you are a blacksmith, you can spot a flaw in one of the portcullis bars and snap one off using some pieces of wood from the abandoned winch. If you spent more time, you could fashion it into a spear (d6) but would risk having one of the guards appear.

Anyone else could eventually figure it out but you would make a lot of noise and risk having a guard show up and see what you are doing. 

## The guards 

The guards come by occasionally. Use the All Purpose Oracle Table if it matters if they show up now or not. Here is how you could interpret it:

1. They show up, and this time there's two of them.
2. One of them shows up.
3. One of them shows up, but he's been drinking on the job.
4. You have time, but you can hear in the other room that there are two of them, gambling.
5. Nobody shows up.
6. You hear footsteps go downstairs in the other room - the guard has left.

An experienced thief could pickpocket a guard. You would need to get them to come within arm's reach and then be distracted. You would need to make a save.

For an average person, you would probably instead need some large distraction for this to be at all feasible, and still need a save. Consider if you can do anything with one of your trinkets. 

You could also just try and grab the guard through the bars and fight them that way. You are unarmed, so unless you can find a way to get the upper hand, it would be risky.

### Guard stats 

4 HP, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 10 WIL, 1 armor and halberd (d10, bulky).

Note that a halberd is potentially awkward in a tight space. 

Guard dispositions:
1. Checked out of their job
2. Diligent and by the book
3. Nervous
4. Jovial and bored 
5. Sympathetic
6. Cruel 

> For the last one, remember the initial post on safety tools? If that option would make the adventure too dark, don't forget that you can just reroll.

## Investigation results
If you don't want to spoil yourself, read no further in this section.

### Investigating the floor 

The floor consists of four panels on top of rubble. The original floor seems to have collapsed and been replaced with hard packed dirt. AFter lifting all four floorboards, you see that the packed earth has eroded a bit, and a narrow tunnel goes downwards. It's narrow enough you could climb up and down it by bracing yourself against both walls of the tunnel.
