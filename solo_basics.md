# Using oracles
An oracle is a random table (or another source of randomness) which you can use when you aren't sure what to do next. Oracle tables com in many kinds: some very specific, others very general. When you aren't sure about something in the world, here is a basic table you can use. There will be examples of how to use it in the adventure.

1. No, and there's a complication
2. No 
3. No, but there's something else
4. Yes, but there's a complication
5. Yes 
6. Yes, and it's even better 

If you think things are likely to be dire, you can roll two dice and take the worst roll.
