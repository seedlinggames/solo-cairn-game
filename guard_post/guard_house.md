# Investigating the main building 

> I've left this a little looser. One way to do exploration in solo games is to create some thematic random tables and then roll them as you play. Creating the tables for a specific location lets you have a coherent setting and theme, but rolling on them lets you be surprised by what's behind a door.

The main building consists of a main hall, a barracks, a stables, a kitchen, and an office. There are up to 10 soldiers around. Things you might find:

Draw these rooms out as you go. The main door enters into the main hall, and the stable doors are also obvious. There is also a side door - who knows where it goes?

When entering a new room, pick one of the rooms you haven't drawn on the map yet.

1. Barracks
2. Stables (might have a horse that isn't too difficult to ride. Note that you will need to figure out how to feed it at some point.)
3. Kitchen (might have a portable flask of fine ale, which might be a good gift later down the line.)
4. Office (might have)

Use the time of day, followed by the oracle, to decide if a room is occupied. 
To decide if a room has a valuable item, roll a d6. On a 6, it does. Make sure that you are tracking the size of your inventory.

## Main hall
Usually empty at night, usually has 1d4+1 soldiers around during the day. 

## Barracks
Possible valuable item: a soldier's uniform that fits you relatively well and a book of passphrases

5 bunkbeds and a storage cabinet. Meager personal goods in sacks hanging from hooks on the bed. The beds are worn and the room smells musty. There is a small side room with a bucket and a curtain separating it from the main room and it smells worse.

At night, usually contains 10 soldiers (a detatchment) unless they are away on an expedition. During the day, usually contains 1d4 sleeping soldiers.

## Stables
Sometimes there might be someone here taking care of the horses. 1d6-1 horses.

Possible valuable item: a horse that's willing to let you ride it. If you keep the horse for longer than just a few hours, you'll need to figure out how to feed it.

## Kitchen
There might be 2-3 soldiers cooking. You can tell because of the cooking noises and smell.

## Office and Captain's Bedroom 

If there's someone in here, it's the captain. Stats:

4 HP, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 10 WIL, 2 armor and sword (d8).

Possible valuable items:
-  100 gp, meant to be paid out in wages
- A map showing what's in the immediate 3 mile radius (see [TODO])
