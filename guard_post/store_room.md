# Escaping the building 

The door at the far end of the hallway is not locked. It opens into a store room.

## Store room
The store room sometimes contains a guard, occasionally two guards, who will be talking or gambling. Inside the store room, there isn't enough space for them to effectively use their halberds because of how full it is, so you will be on an even footing.

It's a room similar to the one you were in, except there is a staircase leading down and the window is not blocked. It contains a small table and two chairs, with a deck of cards on it. There is a pile of large and heavy furs, tied up and labeled, and a lot of broken disorganized junk. Given a few minutes, you could search through it and find a few useful items. Roll for starting gear as in the Cairn book.

You can see a forest out the window. You might be able to discern that it faces north.

## Down the stairs

There is nobody downstairs, unless someone happens to be entering the building and going upstairs. There are more furs and other goods from the forest tied up in bundles, as well as some food stores (three days worth of which are relatively portable) and a torch.  If there were guards upstairs, the door is bolted shut from the inside, but you can easily unlock it.  The door opens on the opposite side from the window.

## Outside 

You can see now that the building you were in is a ruined gatehouse. The surrounding buildings have largely been engulfed by a landslide.

There's a second building just outside of the landslide, where the guards live. 

Is it night? Will you be able to sneak away easily? Let's use the oracle table again:
1. No, and there are people outside. You need to run for the forest!
2. No, but nobody is immediately around. You have time to head straight for the forest without being noticed.
3. No, and most of the soldiers are away on some expedition.
4. Yes, but the other building is lively and well lit.
5. Yes, and it seems like everyone is asleep.
6. Yes, and you see a door is open and hear a horse whinnying... 

If you go into the forest, (TODO)
