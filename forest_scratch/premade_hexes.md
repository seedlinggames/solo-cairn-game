# Premade forest hexes 

## Random hexes
These were made using the tables [here](./travel_procedures.md).

### 1.  Enclosed + water

There's an isolated spring in the water, it doesn't flow anywhere. If it's isolated, maybe it has something strange and unusal living there?

Let's roll on the random encounters table, but the sub-table "A being". We get a lesser beast. Fish seem obvious. They're good food, but they have sharp teeth.

2 HP, 6 STR, 12 DEX, 6 WIL, teeth (d6)

If they draw blood (do STR damage), 1d6 more appear.

### 2. Open + grass 

A large clearing in the trees. You roll "something strange" on the encounter table. A ring of stones in the middle, with markings - maybe it keeps the forest at bay? The clearing, you notice, is perfectly round.

### 3.  Hidden + mud 

Quicksand up ahead! You see objects sunk and half-buried. Will yo find a way across, or take a detour?  For a random encounter, you roll "something useful - a useful item" 

### 4. Slow + brambles 

There's a massive thicket of brambles up ahead. To go this way, you'll need a tool to clear the brambles, and expect it to take 3 times as long to get through. It could also be a good place to make your own hiding place.

A great beast: You see an enormous bird the size of a house take off from the middle of it.  It must have a lair in the center. 

### 5. Climb + rocks 

There's a cliff here. It might extend several hexes. 

Roll something dangerous: A small number of rocks fall the moment you try and climb. You suspect the whole cliff is in danger of a rockslide. 

### 6. Built + massive trees.

When rolling for an encounter here, I'll skip right ahead to "outlaw" because that seems most obvious and we haven't encountered any people yet.

I rolled "a deserter". 

There are some large trees here, and they seem to have houses carved into them, with a little door in the front here. The doors are too small for an adult human to comfortably fit in, as is the ceiling inside. A deserter from the army has taken up residence here, although they don't comfortably fit. They are suspicious of strangers, and are especially wary
