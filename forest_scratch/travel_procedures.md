## Spark tables 

> A spark table is essentially a kind of oracle table. They are lists of fairly evocative words, usually tailored to a setting or location, and often the results of rolls on different tables are meant to be combined. The meaning of the words combined is usually vague enough that different people will come up with different answers, but hopefully specific enough to help the imagination.
> What if youc an't think of any ideas? I often play solo games over long periods of time. If I'm creatively stuck, I might put it aside fro a while and do something where my mind can wander. A lot of creative inspiration comes when cleaning the house, taking a shower, or walking around the neighborhood. 
> If you're creatively stuck, try adding more prompts. You can use random tables in other game books you have, or you can do things like open a book to a random page, or draw a tarot card.
