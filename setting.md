# Setting summary

## The Broken Marches

### History 
This was once a more heavily inhabited region, with towns, castles, and other settlements. A series of earthquakes destroyed most of these settlements, however, and the region was largely abandoned.

### Economy
The area is still known for containing both copper and gold in the hills. More commonly, merchants pass through

### Current situation

The marquess is trying to bring order to the region, ruling from the XXX Lowlands. The roads are heavily patrolled, and the atmosphere on the roads is one of oppressive suspicion.

## The XXX Lowlands 

The Marquess rules from here. There are a few towns and farming villages, but its main potential source of wealth is taming the Broken Marches again and putting the mines under the control of the nobles.

You originate from here, and are unlikely to return.

## The Duchy of XXXX Bay 

The lands around this bay are ruled by the Duchess XXXX. It has fertile farmlands and the bay teems with fish. It's a peaceful place, where people by and large live simple lives with everything they need but perhaps not everything they want. 

Technically, the Marquess owes alleigance to the Duchy, but the Duchess generally does not concern herself with the Broken Marches or the XXX Lowlands unless she has to.

## Last Town 

This is the last town before entering the Broken Marches, and the first town you are likely to enter in the Duchy. It's full of naive people seeking their fortune in the Broken Marches.

Most importantly, the Last Town is not part of the jurisdiction of the Marquess. If you can reach the town and you're wanted in the Marches, you're free, unless you cause enough trouble to be sent back.


## What this means for your game

The Broken Marches are full of dungeons and monsters. Rival factions might be trying to loot the ruins as well. Some of them are mapped in this adventure, but you could easily put in dungeons from other modules (or of your own creation) further afield.

The XXX Lowlands are not designed to play a major part in your game: rather they exist to explain who is patrolling the Broken Marches and why you were arrested at the beginning of the game.
