# Character Creation 

This is somewhat abbreviated from the rules in Cairn. This makes it possible to walk you through how to use various character attributes in different circumstances. If you are more confident and experienced at solo play, then feel free to roll a character as normal, minus equipment.

## Name and traits 

This is mostly the same as in the Cairn book, except that we'll do backgrounds separately.

Here are some alternate names: 

1. Vezi
2. Thiwa
3. Oworth
4. Drun
5. Ezu
6. Sada
7. Vovek
8. Orarth
9. Medet 
10. Alip 
11. Suzu
12. Ajin
13. Nere 
12. Grun
13. Siwi
14. Brab
15. Korin 
16. Seda
17. Ola
18. Kaip 
19. Olarn
20. Miren

Roll for character traits on page 6 of the Cairn book. I usually only roll for 2 elements of their physical appearance.

For misfortunes, instead roll on this table:
1. You were accused of a crime, correctly (what crime?)
2. You are falsely accused of a crime, but you just look a lot like a wanted criminal
3. A brand or tattoo marks you as having committed a crime in the past
4. To raise money, it is illegal to travel through these parts without a license you cannot afford
5. The corrupt guards here demand a bribe to pass through which you could not pay
6. Travelers are being pressed into service of the Marquesse to help clear this region, a dangerous and unrewarding job

TODO alternate character traits?


Note: whenever a table says to roll, you can also just pick what calls out to you. Tables mostly fit into two categories.  If there's an element of danger, this doesn't always work so well, because you can miss out on the fun of that risk. But if the table exists to provide variety, then it's up to you.

## Background
You were headed to Last Town when you got arrested and thrown in a makeshift dungeon, for the reasons mentioned in your misfortunes. 

1. Herbalist.
  - You automatically know the properties of plants, unless there's now ay you've seen it before.
  - If it seems plausible that you might know something or have a skill because of your herbalist background, you can just do that.
2. Blacksmith 
  - Given access to a forge and tools, you can produce metal items.
  - More relevant to this adventure, you can perform simple repairs on metal objects, find weak points in metal, etc.
3. Pickpocket
  - You can pickpocket people, though you might need to make a save to avoid being caught.
  - You can generally accomplish things that require a light and delicate hand that others might need to roll a save for.

## Ability scores and hit protection 
Roll as in the Cairn book.

## Equipment
You will find and roll for equipment during the adventure. When you start out, you only were left with a trinket that you could hide on your person.

1. Marbles
2. Chalk
3. A small bell
4. A whistle 
5. A small roll of twine
6. A dice set
